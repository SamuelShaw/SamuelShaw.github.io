 UrZone is the communication app of the future! For our final project at The Iron Yard coding academy, my partner, Phillip English and I created the iOS app, UrZone, a context based app focused on allowing users to engage with the environment around them using iBeacon technology!

To accomplish this, we decided to hardcode our first beta to test the iBeacon ranges by their minor number. iBeacons ping a signal to nearby devices using Bluetooth Low Energy, so no need for wifi! With the ping speed from the iBeacons, we were able to allow a share wall in the form of an instant messenger chat when the user is in proximity of the beacon's pings..

By doing this, the thought of use cases are almost limitless! When the user is within proximity of a given beacon, a chat is popped into view, vice versa when the user leaves proximity.. In this way we get our users to interact with the environment around them! For example, being able to keep a beacon in your pocket making your body a walking chatroom! Another example is a mother may place a message in a chat that is viewed only from being in the proximity of a beacon located in the kitchen or another message by his or her's bedroom door that their food is in the oven.. Her child can later read this message and handle appropriately.

But lets be honest, that can be a pretty boring use case for the most part right?! Well we agree! The future of UrZone will be international scavenger hunts and capture the flag games between users for redeemable points for special prizes only received from us, the makers of UrZone!!! So, are you ready to take control of Ur zone?
