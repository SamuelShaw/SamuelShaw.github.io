Flying Colors is a simple app with a cloud database run by parse to teach kids their primary colors and also colors by name in alphabetical order. A user can select a color and be taken to a new view where the name of the color is vividly broadcasted on screen and playback audio of the color name is selectable at the tap of a button! Currently there are three rows of colors to learn.. primary colors, colors beginning in the letter "A", and colors beginning in the letter "B".
