My Universal Application project isn't an app at all, but rather a guideline that allows me to create apps that work on both iPhones and iPads. With this guide I can create one app that works with both devices. Check out source code [here](https://github.com/SamuelShaw/UniversalApplication/tree/master/UniversalApplication)!
