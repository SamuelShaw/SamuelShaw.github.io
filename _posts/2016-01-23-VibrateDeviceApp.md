Vibrate Device is a super easy app that allows the user to press a button to cause the IPhone they are currently using to vibrate. This function will allow the use of bringing a more realistic effect by giving the user feedback from the device when they press certain buttons or interact with different aspects of a game. Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/SamuelShaw/VibrateDevice).
